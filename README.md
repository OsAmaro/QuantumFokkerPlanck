Abstract: _Near-future experiments in Petawatt class laser scattering are expected to produce a high flux of gamma-ray photons and electron-positron pairs through Strong Field Quantum Electrodynamical processes. We study the stochastic cooling of an electron beam in a strong constant uniform magnetic field, both their particle distribution functions and their energy momenta. We apply the quantum-hybrid Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution to the Fokker-Planck equation describing this process. We also obtain approximate closed-form analytical solutions, filling a gap in the literature. This work will be useful as a first step towards quantum simulation of strong-field plasma physics where diffusion processes are important_
